              The `ID` scalar type represents a unique identifier, often used to
              refetch an object or as key for a cache. The ID type appears in a JSON
              response as a String; however, it is not intended to be human-readable.
              When expected as an input type, any string (such as `4`) or integer
              (such as `4`) input value will be accepted as an ID.
